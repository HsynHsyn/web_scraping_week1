### 2-InSight: Mars Weather Service API

(Last Updated: 3/30/2021)

NASA’s InSight Mars lander takes continuous weather measurements (temperature, wind, pressure) on the surface of Mars at Elysium Planitia, a flat, smooth plain near Mars’ equator. Please note that there are sometimes problems with the sensors on Mars that result in missing data! If you see a long gap, a search result may bring up more information on whether it is a long-lasting problem. Summaries of these data are available at https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/.
